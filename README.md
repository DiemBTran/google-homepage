Hello. The date is Monday November 18, 2019. Bach and I are at Hawthorn coffee. It's been two months since we starte The Odin Project, and we have only brushed on a few introductory Git and HTML/CSS concepts. We are finally moving onto our first real project for Wev Dev 101: deconstructing an existing web page (Google.com homepage) and rebuilding it. I hope we finish this by the first week of December! 

We don't have to worry about links to nowhere, forms that won't submit, and hard coding the search results. By the end of this project, we should be able to demonstrate these skills: moving divs around a page, sticking divs onto the top or bottom of the page, using colors and background colors, using URLS of images, centering elements, CSS styling, using classes and ids to target specific elements, and building a very basic form.
